## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

I focused on trying to make the functonility different from our previous project. When a user favorites a message it changes color (via inline style and javascript). Users can creat and post a comment, favorite a post, or delete a post. 

## Lessons Learned:

Learning is much more intersting when you have some type of interest in what you're building. This is an important lesson for me and has made me realize how important intention setting is with each and every project I do.
